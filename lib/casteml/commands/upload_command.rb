    Upload pmlfile to Medusa.  See `casteml convert --help' for data
    format.  Note that these also is program to upload files named
    `orochi-upload'.

    This program `#{program_name}' creates sessions (also referred as
    analyses) that unite chemical datasets.  You want to correlate
    each session to a stone.  To do so stone-ID should be specified in
    pmlfile since `#{program_name}' does not take stone-ID as an
    option.

    This program `#{program_name}' stores location (also referred as
    spot) of a session (also referred as analysis) as relative
    coordinate of an imagefile.  Origin of a coordinate is center of
    an image.  A spot coordinate is normalized by the longest side.
    As a consequence, the longest side ranges from -50 to 50.  Use a
    Matlab script `spot.m' to create pmlfile with spots, and follow
    instrution provided by `spots.m'.

    This program `#{program_name}' uploads datasets, coordinates, and
    imagefile `my-spots-picture.jpg'.  Note imagefile is described in
    pmlfile and NOT in arguments.  When this program finds imageometry
    file file `my-spots-picture.geo' (Affine matrix of xy-on-image to
    vs space), it also uploads it.  Use `spots.m' to create pmlfile
    with spots.  An example of the imageometry file is shown below.

    $ cat my-spots-picture.geo
    affine_xy2vs:
    - [1.2, 0.0,  4.2]
    - [0.0, 1.2, -1.3]
    - [  0,   0,  1.0]
